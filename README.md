This is a quickly written python script which builds a crude image gallery by traversing all subdirectories of the directory it is in. In each directory, it looks for any image files, and then creates an index.html file which contains image tags for all images found in the directory. Other file types and subdirectories simply have a href link created for them. The script also logs the creation of the gallery and stores this log in "log.txt" at the root directory. Development of this script is limited as it currently performs its given task. Lastly, please note that this script requires the Python Image Library to run.
